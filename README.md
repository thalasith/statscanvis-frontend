# Stats Canada Visualization Frontend

This is the front end of a two part project. Please refer to the [StatsCanVis-Pyscrapper](https://github.com/thalasith/statscanvis-pyscrapper)

## What components does this App have?

I made it as simple as possible:

- Next.js for the framework
- Tailwind for the CSS
- Prisma for the ORM
- MYSQL for the database
- Recharts for the data visualizations
